I am a rising junior at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in software systems. I have experience in working with software applications, embedded systems, distributed systems, machine learning and low-level programming. I am always looking for ways to learn about new innovative technology that can change the world around us.

Currently, I am looking for Software Engineering/Technology internships for the Summer of 2024. Feel free to connect with me via `email` ([saluakintayo@gmail.com](saluakintayo@gmail.com)) and `Linkedin` ([www.linkedin.com/in/akintayo-salu](www.linkedin.com/in/akintayo-salu)).
